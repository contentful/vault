# Vault

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/contentful/vault.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/contentful/vault/builds#)

Vault is an Android library that simplifies persistence of data from Contentful via SQLite. It lets you define Java representations for your Contentful models. Then, at compile-time it will create a corresponding database schema by generating all the required boilerplate code and injecting it to the classpath. It is also bundled with a complementary lightweight runtime which exposes a simple ORM-like API for pulling resources from the generated database.

Setup
=====

Grab via Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.contentful.vault</groupId>
  <artifactId>compiler</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0/version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.contentful.vault</groupId>
  <artifactId>core</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
or Gradle:
```groovy
apt 'com.contentful.vault:compiler:2.1.0'
compile 'com.contentful.vault:core:2.1.0'
```

Note for Gradle users, make sure to use the [android-apt][apt] Gradle plugin, which lets you configure compile-time only dependencies.

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].

### Models & Fields

Models are defined by declaring a subclass of the `Resource` class. Annotate the class with `@ContentType`, which takes the Content Type's ID as its value.

Fields are defined by annotating class attributes with the `@Field` annotation. 
```java
@ContentType("cat")
public class Cat extends Resource {
  @Field public String name;
  @Field public Cat bestFriend;
  @Field public Asset image;
}
```

By default, the name of the attribute will be used as the field's ID, but can also be specified explicitly:
```java
@Field("field-id-goes-here") 
public String someField; 
```

Field ids are escaped and so can be used regularly, however when making queries with a WHERE condition it is up to the caller to escape the field name in case it is a reserved keyword. For example, consider the following model:
```java
@ContentType("...")
public class Foo extends Resource {
  @Field public String order;
}
```

Since *order* is a reserved SQLite keyword, in order to make a query which references that field here is how to escape it:
```java
vault.fetch(Foo.class)
    .where("`" + Foo$Fields.ORDER "` = ?", "bar")
    .first();
```

### Spaces

Spaces can be defined by declaring a class annotated with the `@Space` annotation. It is required to specify the Space ID, an array of model classes and an array of locale codes you wish to persist:

```java
@Space(
    value = "cfexampleapi",
    models = { Cat.class },
    locales = { "en-US", "tlh" }
)
public class DemoSpace { }
```

### Synchronization

Once a Space is defined, invoke Vault to sync the local database with the remote state:

```java
// Client
CDAClient client = CDAClient.builder()
    .setSpace("cfexampleapi")
    .setToken("b4c0n73n7fu1")
    .build();

// Sync
Vault.with(context, DemoSpace.class).requestSync(client);
```

Vault will use a worker thread to request incremental updates from the Sync API and reflect the remote changes to its database.
Once sync is completed, Vault will fire a broadcast with the action `Vault.ACTION_SYNC_COMPLETE`.

Alternatively, you can provide a `SyncCallback` which will be invoked once sync is completed, but make sure to cancel it according to its host lifecycle events:

```java
class SomeActivity extends Activity {
  SyncCallback callback;
  
  @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    
    Vault.with(this, DemoSpace.class).requestSync(client, callback = new SyncCallback() {
      @Override public void onResult(SyncResult result) {
        if (result.isSuccessful()) {
          // Success \o/
        } else {
          // Failure
        }
      }
    });
  }
  
  @Override protected void onDestroy() {
    Vault.cancel(callback);
    super.onDestroy();
  }
}
```

Similarly, if you're using RxJava, you can be notified of sync results via an Observable:
```java
Vault.observeSyncResults() // returns Observable<SyncResult>
```

### Queries

Vault provides a wrapper around its generated database which can be easily used to fetch persisted objects, some examples:

```java
Vault vault = Vault.with(context, DemoSpace.class);

// Fetch the first Cat
vault.fetch(Cat.class)
    .first();
    
// Fetch the most recently updated Cat
vault.fetch(Cat.class)
    .order(Cat$Fields.UPDATED_AT + " DESC")
    .first();

// Fetch a Cat with a specific name
vault.fetch(Cat.class)
    .where(Cat$Fields.NAME + " = ?", "Nyan Cat")
    .first();
    
// Fetch all Cats, ordered by creation date:
vault.fetch(Cat.class)
    .order(Cat$Fields.CREATED_AT)
    .all();

// Fetch all Cats, using the Klingon locale:
vault.fetch(Cat.class)
    .all("tlh");
```

If you're using RxJava, you can create queries with the `observe()` method, for example:
```java
vault.observe(Cat.class)
    .where(Cat$Fields.NAME + " = ?", "Happy Cat")
    .all() // returns Observable<Cat>
```

The above example creates an `Observable` that subscribes and observes on the same thread initiating the query, so make sure to change that according to your requirements. A typical use-case would be:
```java
vault.observe(Cat.class)
    .all()
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
```

### Migrations

Whenever changes are introduced to any of the previously used models, a migration has to be applied. Simply increment the version number for your space to trigger a migration:

```java
@Space(value = "cfexampleapi", models = { Cat.class }, dbVersion = 2)
public class DemoSpace { }
```

Note: this will delete any previously persisted data.

### Database pre-seeding

Depending on the amount of content in a given space, initial synchronization might take some time. For that we've added support to pre-seed the database with static content. In order to do that one has to add an existing Vault database file into the **assets** folder of the project, and then reference this file through the **copyPath** attribute, for example:

```java
@Space(value = "foo", models = { Bar.class }, copyPath = "vault_file_name.db")
public class FooSpace { }
```

Note that in order to add this functionality to an already shipped app, the **dbVersion** value has to be increased, as it causes invalidation of any pre-existing content.
